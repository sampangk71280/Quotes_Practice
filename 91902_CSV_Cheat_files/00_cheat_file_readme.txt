*** Cheat Files ***

These files save you the pain of doing the VLOOKUP thing.  Only use them once you understand HOW to change data into third normal form.

In the assessment you can ask your teacher to help you with the VLOOKUP thing but will need to tell them exactly what you want (ie: you tell them the structure and they will help you generate the .csv files)
